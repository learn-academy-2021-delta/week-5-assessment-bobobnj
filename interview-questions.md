# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Are (most) Ruby methods accessors or mutators?

  Your answer: Mostly they are accessors. That I'm sure of. As far as which are mutators, I'm unaware.

  Researched answer: Mostly, Ruby methods are all accessors. The do not mutate the object which they are called on however you can permanently change an object by following it with the bang! operator.


2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: Block is basically the housing for code or logic. That all I can really think of when I think of block. it's the area where code lives.

  Researched answer: Block Ruby is an anonymous function similar to what you would see in Javascript. Created with do/end keywords or curlies {}, they can have multiple parameters and this is how code is passed to a method.



3. What is a gem? Gem is a code library specific to ruby. It's the jest of Javascript in ruby's case. Specifically I have used them for testing purposes but to my understanding they allow developers to run certain programs.

  Your answer: Gem is a code library specific to ruby. It's the jest of Javascript in ruby's case. Specifically I have used them for testing purposes but to my understanding they allow developers to run certain programs.

  Researched answer: Gem is a snippet of code functionality that allow sharing Ruby easier by creating a standard format for distribution. Specifically in our case at LEARN, we installed rspec gem by using the gem instal command.



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: I have heard of relational database. Specifically by name I'm guessing the data is relational. Also considering there is a relational database, there would be other databases; otherwise wouldn't it just be called database? I would guess that there are multiple databases types out there to suffice the needs of on 2021

  Researched answer: Relational databases store data in tables and the relationship between each datapoint is distinct, which allows for easy data surfing. This particular relationship is called schema. Typically relational databases use SQLanguage.

  It appears that there is at leas a non-relational database. It's simple in it's design, excels in horizontal scaling, faster, and cheaper than relational database managers. This database is non SQL and deals in data retrieval means that differ from the tabular relations used in relational databases.



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary key... in relation to what? Sorry but so much information is being smashed in by head that, specifically, a primary key is not standing out.

  Researched answer: Primary key is the relational database table specially designed to identify each table record and there can only be one per table. Using a unique identifier, data can be quickly parsed within the table.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: Representational State Transfer is a patter ti follow when structuring routes between the server and the client. They are an attempt to bring the operations that can be applied to an object into HTTP requests.

2. JSON: Javascript Object Notation is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on Java syntax.

3. ERB: Embedded Ruby or Templated Ruby is a file structure that allows us to code in HTML and drop Ruby code into the view file.

4. Params: They allow us to add more information to our program by passing a value into the controller.

5. API: Application Programming Interface intermediates between applications, allowing them to communicate.
